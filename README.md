## Questions

### Part-A

1. Write parallel program using OpenMP to sort n element using merge sort.

2. Write a program to Multiply a matrix by a vector and get the result of the operation.

3. Write an OpenMP program which demonstrates how to "multitask",
implement two separate task, one to generate prime table and other to
generate sine table for a given input using OpenMP for parallel execution.
Justify the inference.

4. Write a program to show how first private clause works. (Factorial program)
